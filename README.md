# LAHACKS
# Inspiration
Boredom. Something that every student experiences. While it's important to focus, sometimes, we could all use a break. But what should you do in your break? Surely you don't want to just scroll Youtube or Tiktok, right? SideQuest aims to answer that question, by giving students healthy, life-balancing side quests to help them achieve both academic and personal life success at the same time.

# What it does
SideQuest is a game-ified productivity app that aims to help students be more productive while also having fun. SideQuest allows you to track up to 5 daily tasks, helping students prioritize their most important tasks of the the day, according to the 5-20 rule. SideQuest, as its name suggests, also offers fun SideQuests for students to go on, should they chose to take a break from their studies. The SideQuest will go off for all students at a random time during the day, and once the users have completed their SideQuest, they can share this with other students to help motivate each other.

# How we built it
We built a web app with the MERN stack, consisting of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. We also used the BoredAPI to query for random daily side quests to do.

# Challenges we ran into
We ran into a lot of challenges getting the backend to work properly, especially setting up MongoDB. We were able to work together and eventually get it working though.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of coming up with an idea that we're all really passionate about and being able to learn so much about web development in such a short amount of time.

# What we learned
We learned a lot about the general web development cycle. We also learned a lot about how to develop software as a team, like using SDE tools such as Github.

# What's next for SIDEQUEST
SideQuest will be taking a SideQuest to focus on more features... Stay tuned!
